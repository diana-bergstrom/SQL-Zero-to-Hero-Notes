## Conclusion

The course used both a dvdrental database and exercises database for example data and presented different business questions throughout the course that mimic things that would be encountered in the day to day work of a data analyst. Toward the end of the course I also learned to create my own database (school) to practice creating and modifying tables.

I documented my work that I did in pgAdmin 4 throughout the course during the challenges and assessment tests and compiled it into this notebook.
